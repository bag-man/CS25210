    <h1> About the game </h1>
    <p>This game was made for my Client Side Graphics Programming for the Web module, as part of my second year at university.
    The idea was to create an interactive web game using the HTML5 canvas that incorporated gravity into the gameplay.</p>
    <h1> How to play </h1>
    <p>The objective of the game is to keep the two blocks from falling off of the screen, whilst getting them to cross sides as much as possible. Every 10 seconds the gravity increases in strength; you can see how strong it is with the bar at the bottom of the game. To control the blocks use WASD to control the left block, and ← → ↑ ↓ to control the right one. You can press space to restart at any time.
    
    You also have access to a help menu by clicking at the top left of the screen, and access to your highscores by clicking the bottom left of the screen.</p>
    <h1> Resources used </h1>
    <p> I used JQuery to handle the clicks on the canvas as it was a quicker and easier way of managing it, it would also scale to a bigger canvas easily which is a feature I had wanted to include. Other than that all of the code is my own, I did however use two publicly available sound effects which can be found <a href="http://soundjax.com/reddo/74421%5EDing.mp3">here</a> and <a href="http://soundbible.com/1830-Sad-Trombone.html">here</a>.</p>
